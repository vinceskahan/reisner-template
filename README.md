### modified Reisner Scorekeeping template

This is a modified (with permission) derivative of Reisner Scorekeeping that I currently use.   Please see the link at the bottom of the template for the URL to Alex Reisner's site and consider buying a copy of his official template so he gets a little compensation for his creativity !!!

#### Changelog
